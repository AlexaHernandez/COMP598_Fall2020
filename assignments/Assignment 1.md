# Assignment 1: Contextualized Intelligence and Engineering Challenges, a Case Study

## Overview

For building any intelligent system, we have to understand the context of the intelligent. The AI component is always integrated as one part of a product, and the product is embedded into the interaction, direct or indirect, with some human beings. Building such systems requires considerably more effort than building and tuning a machine learning model. Understanding the context of a specific project, particularly for a domain you are familiar with or interested in, may help you identify specific problems and make a critical judgment about intelligent systems in the real-world ([recent work on ML education](http://students.washington.edu/yreg/icerlearningMLregister.pdf)).

In this assignment, you will combine your experience with using certain AI-enabled system and investigations (using web and research publications on the topic as needed) to understand the context of one concrete intelligent system and identify primary software engineering concerns in building that system.

## Tasks and Questions

**Task1:**
Choose one product of an intelligent system that you are most familiar with/interested in. Remember to choose one system of which the performance will directly impact you (or people around you). For your inspiration, here are some examples and the possible reasons you might have (in the parenthesis):
- A candidate screening system for employment (you are heading to the job market in near future);
- An email auto-completion or correction system (you use those online services daily);
- An auto-pilot system for self-driving vehicles (you are a regular uber customer, or you own a car with an auto-pilot system);
- A virtual assistant system (you use Amazon Echo or Google Home, or Apple Siri);
- An advertisement recommender system (you want to buy products that fit your need online).


Questions:
1. **Question 1.1:** Explain what kind of system you select in this case study and the reason of your selection. [10]
1. **Question 1.2:** What kind of problem the intelligent system is trying to solve? What makes this problem hard? What are the particular strengths of having an intelligent system rather than a traditional system with deterministic behavior? What are the weaknesses of an intelligent system in this context compare to a traditional system? [25]
2. **Question 1.3:** What qualities were important for a team to consider when builiding this system? Identify relevant qualities, briefly explain why they are important for the project, and how you will be impacted as a user of this system. Then, give a brief description of how the team could check whether those qualities are sufficiently achieved in the project (e.g., specific metrics to measure the quality). [25]

**Task 2:**
Please read this work: 
[A taxonomy of software engineering challenges for machine learning systems: An empirical investigation](https://research.chalmers.se/publication/512250/file/512250_Fulltext.pdf)

Through a multiple-case study, the authors has created a taxonomy for the identified SE challenges. What challenges are relevant to building the intelligent system you are studying. Are there any challenges you think are important but are not included in the taxonomy?

Questions:
1. **Question 2.1:** Choose at least three most important **engineering** challenges either from or beyond the taxonomy. Discuss why they were important to your case. [30]
4. **Question 2.2:** Discuss what potential options does the team have to address the challenges identified in Q2.1. [10]

Submit your answers as a single PDF document to MyCourse. Make sure your document is concise and well structured.


## Grading

This assignment is worth 100 points. The grading includes two phases:

**Peer Editor (25 points):**
Everyone will read one submission of your classmates after the initial submission. The editor's role is to provide concrete **compliments, suggestions, and/or corrections** on the submission (directly on the PDF) considering the following grading criteria:
- each question is completely answered;
- the answer to the question is clear and effective;
- the discussion is supported either by evidence or reasonable speculation. 

You will be graded on how well you **serve as a editor**, in particular, to what extent your comments/suggestions are clear and constructive, not the length of the comments. 


**Submission Grade (75 points):**
After you receive the peer editor's comments, please revise your submission, and submit the revised version to MyCourse. We will grade this version using the same criteria during the peer editing. The percentage of the grade for each question is listed after the question in [XX].
