# Activity: Learning Android App Development 
Let's learn Android App Development together! 

## Activity Description
In this activity you will take turns teaching each other Android app development topics. You are expected to complete the [Build Your First App](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp) tutorial individually before the first lesson which will take place on *XXX*.

## Lesson Content 
Each lesson will cover one of the sub-topics listed in the [table](#topics-and\-sub-topics) below. Lessons should be about 10 minutes in length and include two sections:

**1. Brief Overview (5 mins):** First, present a brief overview of your sub-topic using a couple of slides. 

**2. Coding Example (5 mins):** Next, you will present a coding example to help your peers understand how the sub-topic is implemented in practice. For this section, you are expected to produce a small sample app that showcases the sub-topic. The app does not need to be sophisticated. It can be very simple. The only requirement is that it demonstrates the sub-topic. 

To provide inspiration, I have included a link to the corresponding [Google Developers Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=android) for each sub-topic (see [table](#topics-and-sub\-topics) below). Each codelab steps readers through the process of building a small app that features the sub-topic. You are free to use the codelab app as your coding example. You may also find other sample apps or invent your own. Do not forget to source any sample apps that are not your own.  

In terms of presentation style, you have two options: (1) you develop the sample app in advanced and walk your peers through the code; (2) you live code the sub-topic section of your sample app. If you select this option, you must upload the skeleton of your sample app beforehand so that your peers may follow along. 

## Sub-topic Selection
Please email Alexa with your top 3 sub-topics by *XXX*. She will do her best to accommodate everyone's preferences. 
 
 ## Deliverables
 There are two deliverables: the slide deck and the sample app. Please upload the deliverables in a folder titled `you-sub-topic` under the `learning-android` folder by the end your lesson date.

## Notes for Martin
* There are currently **22 students** enrolled in the course but only **19 sub-topics**. I figured a few students will drop the course. If not, here is a list of additional sub-topics: [Places API](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-training-places-api?index=..%2F..advanced-android-training#3), [Espresso for UI Testing](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-espresso-for-ui-testing?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#0), [CameraX](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/camerax-getting-started?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fcodelabs.developers.google.com%2F%3Fcat%3Dandroid#0), [Profile GPU Rendering Tool](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-training-profile-gpu?index=..%2F..advanced-android-training#0), [Memory Profiler Tool](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-android-training-memory-profiler?index=..%2F..advanced-android-training#0), [Adaptive Layouts](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-adaptive-layouts?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#0), [Connectivity](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity). Feel free to swap in/out sub-topics.
* For the **Coding Example** section, I am not sure if you want to give presenters the option to either do live coding or walk through their already-implemented code, or enforce the live coding structure. I think live coding would be more engaging. The audience would also probably retain more and gain a deeper understanding as they can follow along, resembling a real tutorial structure. The downside is that presenters will probably be more comfortable explaining already-implemented code.
* There are no corresponding Google Developers Codelabs for 3 topics (App Resources, App Manifest, and Permissions). However, the Developer Guides provide ample sample code so students can easily create their own sample app.
	* Additionally, I think that the Permissions lessons should have a longer overview (7 mins) and a shorter coding example (3 mins). There are many important aspects to cover (the standard permissions workflow, permissions best practices, types of permissions) which a strongly-related to privacy. Moreover, the code to request permissions is not that complicated.
