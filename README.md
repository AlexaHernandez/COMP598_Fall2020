## Description
This course is going to explore how to build an intelligent system from a software engineering perspective, from requirement gathering and analysis to deployment and maintenance. We will also touch AI ethics and its implications to design.


## Expected Outcome

## Prerequisite
While there are no official prerequisite courses, you will enjoy and appreciate this course more if you have taken COMP303, COMP424 and COMP551 already.

## Reference Material
We will not concentrate on any particular resources. Instead, the readings will include content from book chapters, research papers, blog posts, talks, etc. The pointers to those content will be added to the schedule later.

- **Books**: 
[Building Intelligent Systems <em>A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering</em>](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484234310).
