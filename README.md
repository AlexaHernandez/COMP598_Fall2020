- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this course will be taught remotely. The detailed format will be updated soon.

- I normally design many in-class activities for upper-level classes to motivate discussion and collaborative learning. Therefore, it is important to attend the lectures in order to gain the best learning experience – it cannot be replaced by watching the videos afterward. Given the special circumstance of this semester, I won't require you to attend all the lectures in real-time and try to balance the in-class and out-of-class effort. However, I would encourage you to register next year if you cannot attend most of the lectures. 

## Description
This course is going to explore how to build an intelligent system from a software engineering perspective, from requirement gathering and analysis to deployment and maintenance. We will also touch AI ethics and its implications to design.

## Prerequisite
While there are no official prerequisite courses, you will enjoy and appreciate this course more if you have taken COMP303, COMP424 and COMP551 already.

## Reference Material
We will not concentrate on any particular resources. Instead, the readings will include content from book chapters, research papers, blog posts, talks, etc. The pointers to those content will be added to the schedule later.

- **Books**: 
[Building Intelligent Systems <em>A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering</em>](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484234310). 


## Assessment and Evaluation (Tentative)

|  Assessment Method | Weight |
